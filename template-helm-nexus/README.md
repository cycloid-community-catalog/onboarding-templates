# stack-terraform-ansible

Ready to use stack which deploys a Nexus Repository service (as an example) using Terraform and then Ansible.
Feel free to update the Terraform HCL code, the Ansible playbook, the .forms.yml file to expose the relevant input parameters to your end-users, as well as this README.
